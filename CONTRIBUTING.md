# Contributing to WWTP Autonomous Management Benchmark

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This benchmark aims to evaluate AI capabilities in critical infrastructure management, and community input makes it stronger.

## How to Contribute

### 🆕 Propose New Scenarios
Open an issue with:
- **Scenario description:** What emergency situation should be tested?
- **Core challenge:** What capability does it evaluate?
- **Grading criteria:** How should responses be scored?
- **Realism basis:** Is this based on real operational experience?

### 🤖 Test Additional Models
1. Run the benchmark scenarios on Kaggle
2. Document model name, version, and configuration
3. Share results via pull request or issue

### 👥 Test Team Configurations
- Try different model-to-role assignments
- Experiment with different team sizes (3-agent, 5-agent, etc.)
- Test with alternative models in each role

### 📝 Improve Evaluation
- Suggest new scoring criteria
- Identify edge cases in existing scenarios
- Report scoring inconsistencies

## Guidelines

- All contributions must be based on **factual engineering knowledge**
- Scenarios should reflect **real operational situations**, not theoretical exercises
- Safety-critical decisions must have **verifiable correct answers**
- Keep evaluations **objective and reproducible**
